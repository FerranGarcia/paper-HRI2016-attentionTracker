\begin{abstract}
In long term interactions between a human and a robot, it is necessary that the agent exhibits some sort of social intelligence to be able to engage the human providing the appropriate response to specific face-to-face situations. In a educational context, this feature becomes a must due to the fact that engagement plays a very important role in the learning process. Therefore, maximizing the interaction time at a high engagement level may provide learning benefits to the children. In this work, a real-time attention tracker based on the head pose estimation using an RGB camera is proposed to be able to identify faults during the interaction and eventually detect low engagement level situations. In this paper we want to show a practical approach to evaluate the engagement that arises from the interaction reporting several experiences in the field, with the robot Nao.

\section{Introduction}
The use of robots in the learning activity presents an opportunity for the children
to interact with an embodied, physical agent as part of the learning experience. Furthermore,
the use of robots in handwriting education comes with the potential to engage the child in
meta-cognition through the learning by teaching paradigm, wherein a student takes the role of
a teacher and experiences stronger educational benefits as a result (such as in \cite{Palinscar1984}).

It becomes a useful to capture the significant passive information provided by the
user during the interaction and adapt the situation to it.


\subsection{Approach}
Defining accurately the human field of view in the implementation is a must. Holmqvist in \cite{holmqvist2011eye} specifies that the visual human range is $ \pm  40\degree $ in the horizontal and $ \pm 25\degree $ in the vertical. In \cite{walker1980clinical} Spector provides a more detailed specification for each eye splitting the vertical range into $ 60\degree $ the upper region and $ 75\degree $ the lower one. Moreover, the horizontal range gets separated in $ 60\degree $ inwards (towards the nose) and $ 95\degree $ outwards. In the present implementation, the first approach explained has been chosen representing the field of view using a cone with such dimensions.

We used a commercial RGB camera acquiring images of 640x480 pixels at 25 fps. The camera was located at 5 cm from the center of Nao's feet and its holder was tied to a wood base for stability purposes. Thus, the camera's objective was 9 cm above and $ 40\degree $ inclination with respect to the surface of the table. 
The subjects were typically located 50 cm away from the robot with the first tablet in front and the second one 30 cm to the left of the first one. In the same way, the experimenter was located around 60 cm to the left of the subject. Finally, two observers were located far away from the interaction field to manually assess

in the context of the CoWriter project \footnote{The primary repository is
\url{https://github.com/chili-epfl/cowriter_letter_learning}.}

 
\subsection{Experimental set-up}
Figure~\ref{drawSetup} illustrates our general experimental setup: a
face-to-face child-robot interaction with an (autonomous) Aldebran's {\sc nao}
robot.

A tactile tablet (with a custom application) is used for both the robot and the
child to write: during a typical round, the child requests the robot to write
something (a single letter, a number or a full word), and push the tablet
towards the robot, the robot writes on the tablet by gesturing the writing (but
without actually physically touching the tablet), the child then pull back the
tablet, corrects the robot's attempt by writing him/herself on top or next to
the robot's writing (see Figure~\ref{fig:diego}), and ``send'' his/her
demonstration to the robot by pressing a small button on the tablet. The robot
``learns'' from this demonstration and tries again.

Since the child is assumed to take on the role of the teacher, we had to ensure
(s)he would be able to manage by him/herself the turn-taking and the overall
progression of the activity (moving to the next letter or word). In our design,
the turn-taking relies on the robot prompting for feedback once it is done with
its writing (simple sentences like ``What do you think?''), and pressing on a
small robot icon on the tablet once the child has finished correcting. In our
experiments, both were easy to grasp for children.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{drawSetup}
    \caption{\small Our experimental setup: face-to-face interaction with a {\sc
        nao} robot.  The robot writes on the tactile tablet, the child then
        corrects the robot by directly overwriting its letters on the tablet
        with a stylus. An adult (either a therapist or an experimenter,
        depending on the studies), remains next to the child to guide the work
        (prompting, turn taking, etc.). A second tablet allows to choose words
        and the camera captures the subject's head. In red, the focuses of attention
        in the scene.}
    \label{drawSetup}
\end{figure}

Implementing such a system raises several challenges that are discussed in detail in \cite{Hood:2015}.

As we observe the current set-up allow us to intuitively identify several focuses of attention along the interaction such as the two tablets, the robot, the experimenter and the observers located in the diagonal.


\subsection{From face detection to Focus of Attention}


In our approach we use the opensource library dlib\footnote{http://dlib.net} \cite{dlib09}, to detect and extract the skeleton of the subject's face and then, use the obtained landmarkers to calculate the head pose orientation estimation. In this way we can estimate where the subject was looking at. Compared to intrusive hardware like head mounted displays or glasses but also images acquired from an RGB-D cameras for instance, this approach has a clear advantage of simplicity but also becomes accurate enough for general purposes in face-to-face interactions. In addition is able to handle different number and positions of participants in the scenario.

%equations

In this work, head orientation is used to predict a person’s focus of attention in face-to-face interactions. Therefore, we assume that head pose is a reliable marker of the attention focus during a social interaction, in both cases human-human, human-robot. Since we estimate where the subject is looking at based on its head position, several important questions arise:

1. How much the head pose contributes to the real gaze of the subject?
2. Which accuracy can we achieve during a real case scenario in terms of head pose estimation tracking?  
3. How accurate can we predict where the subject is looking at based only on the head pose estimation?
4. How can we evaluate the performance of the children based on the activity?

\section{Results}

\section{Discussion}
The results has shown that the percentage of accuracy in the tracking is not only conditioned by the subject's amount of movement, but also by the speed of the same movements: Restless children externalize greater levels of movement decreasing the tracker accuracy. Additionally, several classic computer vision challenges such as the lighting conditions, occlusions and the face angle with respect to the camera are factors that contribute to reduce the accuracy.


\subsubsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
A formula that appears in the running text is called an
inline or in-text formula.  It is produced by the
\textbf{math} environment, which can be
invoked with the usual \texttt{{\char'134}begin. . .{\char'134}end}
construction or with the short form \texttt{\$. . .\$}. You
can use any of the symbols and structures,
from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a
few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how
this equation: \begin{math}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{math},
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsubsection{Display Equations}
A numbered display equation -- one set off by vertical space
from the text and centered horizontally -- is produced
by the \textbf{equation} environment. An unnumbered display
equation is produced by the \textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
and structures available in \LaTeX; this section will just
give a couple of examples of display equations in context.
First, consider the equation, shown as an inline equation above:
\begin{equation}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{equation}
Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \textbf{displaymath}
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
\begin{displaymath}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1\end{displaymath}
and follow it with another numbered equation:
\begin{equation}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f\end{equation}
just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

\subsection{Citations}
Citations to articles \cite{bowman:reasoning,
clark:pct, braams:babel, herlihy:methodology},
conference proceedings \cite{clark:pct} or
books \cite{salas:calculus, Lamport:LaTeX} listed
in the Bibliography section of your
article will occur throughout the text of your article.
You should use BibTeX to automatically produce this bibliography;
you simply need to insert one of several citation commands with
a key of the item cited in the proper location in
the \texttt{.tex} file \cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.
The key is a short reference you invent to uniquely
identify each work; in this sample document, the key is
the first author's surname and a
word from the title.  This identifying key is included
with each item in the \texttt{.bib} file for your article.

The details of the construction of the \texttt{.bib} file
are beyond the scope of this sample document, but more
information can be found in the \textit{Author's Guide},
and exhaustive details in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's
Guide}\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

This article shows only the plainest form
of the citation command, using \texttt{{\char'134}cite}.
This is what is stipulated in the SIGS style specifications.
No other citation format is endorsed or supported.

\subsection{Tables}
Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best
placement for them is typically the top of the page
nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go
in the \textbf{tabular} environment, to
be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired
horizontal and vertical rules.  Again, detailed instructions
on \textbf{tabular} material
is found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 1 is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed
dvi output of this document.

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\ \hline
\O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\ \hline
$\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\ \hline
\$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\ \hline
$\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
\hline\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of
the page's live area, use the environment
\textbf{table*} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this wide
table will ``float" to a location deemed more desirable.
Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 2 is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the
table here with the table in the printed dvi
output of this document.


\begin{table*}
\centering
\caption{Some Typical Commands}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline

\texttt{{\char'134}numberofauthors}& 200& Author enumeration\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\ \hline\end{tabular}
\end{table*}
% end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!

\subsection{Figures}

As was the case with tables, you may want a figure
that spans two columns.  To do this, and still to
ensure proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the environment
\textbf{figure*} to enclose the figure and its caption.
and don't forget to end the environment with
{figure*}, not {figure}!

\begin{figure*}
\centering

\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.eps format)
that needs to span two columns of text.}
\end{figure*}

Note that either {\textbf{.ps}} or {\textbf{.eps}} formats are
used; use
the \texttt{{\char'134}epsfig} or \texttt{{\char'134}psfig}
commands as appropriate for the different file types.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.ps format) that has
been resized with the \texttt{psfig} command.}
\vskip -6pt
\end{figure}

\subsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
Other common constructs that may occur in your article are
the forms for logical constructs like theorems, axioms,
corollaries and proofs.  There are
two forms, one produced by the
command \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} and the
other by the command \texttt{{\char'134}newdef}; perhaps
the clearest and easiest way to distinguish them is
to compare the two in the output of this sample document:

This uses the \textbf{theorem} environment, created by
the\linebreak\texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} command:
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\begin{theorem}
Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$.  If $G$ is
an antiderivative for $f$ on $[a,b]$, then
\begin{displaymath}\int^b_af(t)dt = G(b) - G(a).\end{displaymath}
\end{theorem}

The other uses the \textbf{definition} environment, created
by the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command:
\newdef{definition}{Definition}
\begin{definition}
If $z$ is irrational, then by $e^z$ we mean the
unique number which has
logarithm $z$: \begin{displaymath}{\log e^z = z}\end{displaymath}
\end{definition}

Two lists of constructs that use one of these
forms is given in the
\textit{Author's  Guidelines}.
 
There is one other similar construct environment, which is
already set up
for you; i.e. you must \textit{not} use
a \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to
create it: the \textbf{proof} environment.  Here
is a example of its use:
\begin{proof}
Suppose on the contrary there exists a real number $L$ such that
\begin{displaymath}
\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L.
\end{displaymath}
Then
\begin{displaymath}
l=\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\left[ g{x} \cdot \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right ]
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x) \cdot \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0\cdot L = 0,
\end{displaymath}
which contradicts our assumption that $l\neq 0$.
\end{proof}

Complete rules about using these environments and using the
two different creation commands are in the
\textit{Author's Guide}; please consult it for more
detailed instructions.  If you need to use another construct,
not listed therein, which you want to have the same
formatting as the Theorem
or the Definition\cite{salas:calculus} shown above,
use the \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} or the
\texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command,
respectively, to create it.
